# UE4-ComponentsVehicleSystem
此库的汽车驾驶系统部分基于C++运行 因为一个人写的特殊性 所以无法保证Bug的修复能力 此系统兼容：UE4.26.2 |<br>
初心是完全替换UE4原生汽车驾驶系统 因此省去了绑定骨骼的步骤 仅仅需要静态网格体 同时 手感方面偏向Forza Horizon/Need For Speed|<br>
仅需把该系统下载后解压 下载的为干净项目 可以直接投入开发 如果出现了bug还希望可以改完提交qwq<br>
(>^ω^<)没啦~<br>
The car driving system of this library runs entirely based on blueprints. Due to the particularity of being written by one person, the ability to fix bugs cannot be guaranteed. This system is compatible with: UE4.26.2 |<br>
The original intention is to completely replace the native car driving system of UE4, so the step of binding bones is omitted and only static meshes are needed. At the same time, the feel is biased towards Forza Horizon/Need For Speed|<br>
You only need to download and unzip the system. The downloaded project is a clean project and can be directly put into development. If there are bugs, I hope you can correct them and submit them qwq<br>
